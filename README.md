# House-Pricing-Teamproject
As a team, we set out to develop a model to predict apartments prices in South Korea based on various features about the location and attributes of the particular apartment. Housing prices is an area of big concern all over the world given our ever growing population. South Korea, a country in which about 59.9% of all homes are apartments, is no exception. We will specifically be examining apartments in order to understand which factors contribute most to apartments prices, and to predict prices for apartments that we have not yet seen. For a family searching for a home in South Korea, this model can help them to understand if they are overpaying. For example, if they know the location of the apartment and some basic information, such as the number of rooms, they can determine if they are being offered a fair price. In addition, the landlord or seller of the property can use this model to calculate a fair price for the apartment.
